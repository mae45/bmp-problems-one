# bmp-problems-one

Researching - trying tutorial from youtube and it does not work.

It may be simply that I am missing something. 

In any case I want to open up the topic to see what can be developed and 
expanded on the point of bmp graphics in WinMain. 

The video is: 

Windows GUI Programming with C/C++ ( Win32 API ) | Part -5 | Working with Images (Bitmaps)

The  Link is: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTjlGiCvYZU

Feedback is welcomed. Let me know if there is something else I should include to 
help resolve this problem.

Keep in mind that I am in newbie status where Win32 is concerned. 

I had worked with QT and did not like it with a passion and forgot most of it at 
this point anyway. 

I do however think I will like win32. 

Some back up on what I am working with. 

The IDE I am working with is Codeblocks using the "Win32 GUI Project". Sometimes I do use the
Eclipse CDT in which case the only thing available to use is the console(It works ok 
for that purpose). 

Thank you,
